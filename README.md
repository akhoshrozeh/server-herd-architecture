This is a project I did from UCLA where I implemented an server herd archiecture in Python. The idea for architecture comes from the application server being a bottleneck. In the server herd architecture, multiple application servers communicate directly with each other and the core database, handling rapidly evolving data while the database manages more stable, less frequently accessed information.
